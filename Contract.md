# CS 225 Final Project - Team Contract
Final Project for ghuang23-vperez35-jliu246-ssrane2.
### Communication  
Determining how to communicate with your teammates as well as how often you should be communicating is key to a successful remote project. Discuss with your team and draft a statement detailing the following:

1. Team Meetings  
When and how often often will your team meet? How long should each meeting last? What software or tool will you use to host these meetings? Will someone take notes (record minutes)?

*We shall meet every weekend to discuss the project at hand and increase the duration of meetings the closer it gets to the project deadline. We shall meet through Discord, and Gally shall take notes.*

2. Assistance  
How will your teammates be able to contact you if they need your help or opinion on a task? How quickly should you be expected to respond?

*We shall contact each other through the Discord, which is our primary source of communication. We should respond in no longer than 3 hours for each request.*

3. Respect  
An effective team needs to have an environment which encourages open expression of ideas. How will you ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak and, more importantly, that every member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of others?

*We shall bring this up every meeting and try to make sure input from each person is accounted for.*

### Collaboration
The final project tasks you with finding a fair distribution of labor where each student has some role in the development of each deliverable. However the details of this distribution are up to you. Discuss with your team and draft a statement detailing the following:

1. Work Distribution  
How will you assign workload for this project? How will you address unexpected complications or unforeseen work? You are encouraged to identify the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing work. You do not need to all work equally on a particular deliverable – it is the overall work that should be largely equal.

*Workload shall be assigned in consideration with each of the member’s strengths and weaknesses. Unexpected complications or unforeseen work shall be addressed per communication with the other team members.*

2. Time Commitment  
How many hours of work per week is expected of each group member? Are there prior time commitments that need to be accounted for? How will you address new conflicts or commitments when they do inevitably occur?

*Each group member shall contribute four hours of work per week. If prior time commitments need to be accounted for then said time commitments must be discussed with other group members. If new conflicts or commitments inevitably occur then group members must immediately notify the other group members to discuss a plan of action.*

3. Conflict Resolution  
How will the team resolve situations where there is a disagreement between members? Situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks? Situations where one or more members are habitually late? Are there other hypothetical situations that you as an individual or as a team want to discuss ahead of time? When issues occur, you are strongly encouraged to inform course staff, but only after first trying to resolve the issue as a team in a respectful manner.

*In the event of disagreement between team members, a group meeting will be held to discuss and resolve the issue. Disagreements shall have the opportunity to be resolved in a respectful manner before bringing them to the course staff’s attention. In the event of situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks and/or are habitually late, a group meeting shall be held to discuss group member’s actions and attempt to find a solution before alerting the course staff. In the event of other conflicts, group meetings shall be held as an attempt to resolve any potential conflicts. Informing the course staff shall be the last resort.*
