In this meeting we discussed modifications to our project proposal as our proposal was not approved by our TA. We emailed our TA stating how we modified our proposal hence we are pending his approval to proceed with our project. So far, Jason and Gally have worked on the parser. Jason also filled in the  also filled in vertex and edges between airports, found some edge case with airport commas, weights of the airports. We decided to assign work for this week as follows: 

sakshi - work on the dijisktra algorithm 
veronica - work in parallel with sakshi with algorithm 
jason- test/makefile && betweeness-centrality 
gally - BFS

In this meeting we addressed things that need to be done. We decided that BFS and Betweeness centrality were a priority. Since we started on Dijkstra's and the parser we decided to work on testing for these two. Our goal is to finish everything as soon as possible before next Saturday so that on Saturday we can work on our presentation. We also considered the finals every group member will be taking.

In this meeting we discussed our progress. We chave completed the dijisktra  algoritm, makefile, parser, vertex, adj_list. We are currently working on completing BFS, BC, the presentation, and testing for dijikstra and the parser.
